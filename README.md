# Movie Radar Chart

**Movie Radar Chart is an ethically and objectively film rating system.**

The project was developed for the 2018 “La Fête du Cinéma” contest (a French cinema festival) in partnership with the Association française du cinéma d'animation (AFCA).
Pull requests, feedbacks and suggestions are welcome!

### What is it?

It started with the observation that even if the human prefers synthesised things and to have only one score for choosing between two things, a meta-score is not the best way to rate a movie.
Implicitly, our brain does not evaluate the same things in an animated film, a horror movie, a romantic telefilm or a Hollywood blockbuster.
It is impossible to rate all different kinds of movies on the same scale.

Movie Radar Chart, rather than rate the quality of a movie between 1 ⭐ and 5 ⭐, or between 0% and 100%, offers an unique ethically and objectively rating system.
This helps to nuance a scary movie (like <a rel="visualcinnamon" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/">Scream</a>) and a horror movie (like <a rel="visualcinnamon" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396484/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">It</a>), or avoid to say that a movie is a children's movie or girls' movie, for example.
