# Movie Radar Chart

**Movie Radar Chart is an ethically and objectively film rating system.**

The project was developed for the 2018 “La Fête du Cinéma” contest (a French cinema festival) in partnership with the Association française du cinéma d'animation (AFCA).
Pull requests, feedbacks and suggestions are welcome!

The radar chart function was written by Nadieh Bremer (<a rel="visualcinnamon" href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/">visualcinnamon</a>).

### What is it?

It started with the observation that even if the human prefers synthesised things and to have only one score for choosing between two things, a meta-score is not the best way to rate a movie.
Implicitly, our brain does not evaluate the same things in an animated film, a horror movie, a romantic telefilm or a Hollywood blockbuster.
It is impossible to rate all different kinds of movies on the same scale.

Movie Radar Chart, rather than rate the quality of a movie between 1 ⭐ and 5 ⭐, or between 0% and 100%, offers an unique ethically and objectively rating system.
This helps to nuance a scary movie (like <a rel="Scream" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/">Scream</a>) and a horror movie (like <a rel="It" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396484/">It</a>), or avoid to say that a movie is a children's movie or girls' movie, for example.

### Some examples

Below, three examples of Movie Radar Chart on three various films to try to convince you that this system is more accurate than the other rating systems.

#### <a rel="Aladdin" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6139732/">Aladdin (2019)</a>
Aladdin is a PG movie, a comedy movie based on a love story between the two main characters.
It is a funny movie that not particularly play on our feelings.
It is not an action movie but the plot is fast-paced, without downtime and with a few twists.
It is not a Sci-Fi movie but there are a lot of Sci-Fi effects.
The sound atmosphere is present and original.

#### <a rel="Mission: Impossible" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4912910/">Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)</a>
It is a true action movie, with a touch of humor.
The story takes place in our world, a non-fantastic world, but the movie is not really accurate on action scenes and it is full of Sci-Fi effects.

#### <a rel="Interstellar" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar (2014)</a>
It is a true Sci-Fi movie with a complex plot.
Not based on love story but it is full of emotional charge.
